However, to fully understand \\nthe total weight of capital, we would describe what capital is. “Capital is that part of a country\\'s \\nassets that initiat es surplus production and increases productivity\", says Hernando (2000, p. \\n38), and capitalism can, therefore, be described as a system of governance where citizens own \\nprivate property.
